# Bowers & Wilkins: DSP Interview Challenge 2021
---
## Appendix: No Access To Windows PC
You will not be able to use SigmaStudio to update the DSP path, or be able to tweak the audio controls live via the GUI to ensure correct operation. However this should not prevent you from achieving a successful result.

You can bypass the SigmaStudio setup process and use the files provided to proceed with your filter implementation.
Please see the folder "NoWindows" in your git checkout.

```
"NoWindows" Folder Contents:
    1. jpg images of the DSP signal-path you would have seen in SigmaStudio (Top Level, and ToneControl pages)
    2. The files a SigmaStudio export would have created for you.
