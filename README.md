# Bowers & Wilkins: DSP Interview Challenge 2021
---
## Introduction
Welcome to the Bowers & Wilkins DSP Engineer Challenge.
The object of this exercise is to test the day-to-day skills required by Audio DSP Engineers.

```
The exercise consists of THREE parts:
    1. Part 1: Hardware setup.
    2. Part 2: Audio algorithm design & implementation (Biquad Filter).
    3. Part 3: Creative engineering, and communication skills.
```

**IMPORTANT:**
It should take a few hours to complete the exercise thoroughly.
We THANK YOU for your time and effort. But ask that you do NOT spend a lifetime on the project.

If you get stuck or cannot get part of the system working, intially try to research/debug the problem yourself.
But if things are not working as expected please email: keith.ovenden@soundunited.com who will be happy to try to point you in the right direction.
In the meantime - please skip to the next part of the task.

While the project fits together as a whole, being unable to get a single element working shouldn't mean that you are unable to continue.
We are looking at ALL aspects of your work, and there are plenty of ways to impress - even if the hardware isn't passing audio!

In true 'Bake-Off' Technical Challenge style...
Some instructions are quite thorough (particularly with regard to setting up the hardware). Please read them **carefully** and follow accordingly.
Other instructions are much more ambiguous. It is upto YOU to work out what is required and fill in the details.

**Note: The example 'Volume Control' CLI program is written in C, however, you are NOT restricted to writing in C.**
